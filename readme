Objectives for MyWeatherApp: 
1. Follow along screencast to create simple temperature app
	â€”Finished
2. Put api keys in appropriate location
2. Use Extendable tableviews to display different weather related content
ie. Different sections will feature more detailed forecast information. 
3. Allow user to select and add new cities weather reports.

EC: 
1. trailing closure syntax
-- suggested Treehouse video

Track: 
Notes- this can be a good exercise to learn how to deal with time and dates
by adding different forecast options to the app. 
I can also learn how to use alerts, push notifications, and tableviews.

Rough Schedule: 
	1. Practice with API:
		i. Pull a few more parameters from the API, like the precip
		percentage & low temperature.
		ii. Move API keys to plist
		iIi. After confident pulling simple data, time to start pulling 
		more abstract data, like the forecast were I will need to adjust
		the timezone.
		iii. At this point, I will have a solid amount of data to work
		with and can begin to work with tableviews. The Tabviews will be 
		extendable and feature various data from a single location.
		iv. After I am confident with tableviews, I can move to adding
		new locations to the app.
		v. after adding multiple locations, then I can move
		to creating push notifications (this should be last because now
		the app at least provides some value.
		vi.  Do it all over again from scratch, without any help from 
		the video.

Learning Outcomes (this will become a sample project that is a portfolio piece &
allows me to refer back):
A. API calls and parsing JSON Data
B. Working with dates and time
C. Tableviews and Extendable table views
D. Push Notifications
